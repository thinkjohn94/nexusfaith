							<span>Isn't faith just believing without evidence?</span>
							<span class="expand-icon">+</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-0">
							<p>In the Bible, faith is trust based on testimony, experience, and reasons. It's not a refusal to think; it's a commitment to seek truth. True biblical faith examines evidence and builds on solid foundations.</p>
							<p>Think of faith like trusting a bridge engineer's calculations - you examine their credentials, track record, and the bridge's construction before crossing. Similarly, Christian faith evaluates historical evidence, philosophical arguments, and personal experience.</p>
							<p><strong>Blind faith is not the biblical model.</strong> The apostle Paul appealed to evidence. Jesus pointed to his works. Faith and reason work together, not against each other.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(1)">
							<span>What about Galileo? Wasn't that science vs. religion?</span>
							<span class="expand-icon">+</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-1">
							<p>The Galileo affair was complex, involving politics, personality conflicts, and competing interpretations of both science and Scripture - not simply "Science vs. Religion."</p>
							<p><strong>The fuller context:</strong> Many church leaders supported Galileo initially. The conflict arose when he moved from presenting heliocentrism as a useful model to insisting it was absolute truth, while also mocking the Pope in his writings.</p>
							<p>The broader historical picture shows centuries of church support for learning, with many devout scientists making groundbreaking discoveries. The "warfare thesis" between science and religion is largely a 19th-century myth.</p>
							<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Both scientific theories and biblical interpretation can be refined through careful study. Humility serves both faith and science well.</p>

						<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(2)">
							<span>Can I accept evolution and follow the Bible?</span>
							<span class="expand-icon">+</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-2">
							<p>Many thoughtful Christians believe God could use evolutionary processes as a means of creation. The core theological claim is that <strong>God is the Author</strong>, regardless of the specific mechanism.</p>
							<p><strong>Key distinction:</strong> The Bible tells us <em>that</em> God created; science helps us understand <em>how</em> God created. Genesis emphasizes God's role, purpose, and relationship with creation - not necessarily the timeline or biological mechanisms.</p>
							<p>Christian scientists like Francis Collins (Human Genome Project director) and John Polkinghorne (particle physicist) see evolution as God's elegant method of creation, requiring incredible fine-tuning to work at all.</p>
							<p><strong>The real question:</strong> Is the universe the result of intelligent design or pure chance? The mathematical precision required for life suggests purposeful creation, however it unfolded.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(3)">
							<span>Doesn't entropy rule out order and complexity?</span>
							<span class="expand-icon">+</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-3">
							<p>Entropy applies to <strong>closed systems</strong>. Earth is an open system receiving massive energy input from the sun, allowing local decreases in entropy (increased order) while the overall universal entropy increases.</p>
							<p><strong>However,</strong> the deeper question is about the universe's initial conditions. Our cosmos began with remarkably <strong>low entropy</strong> - incredible order that made all subsequent structure possible.</p>
							<p>This initial fine-tuning is what cosmologists find most remarkable: the universe started with just the right amount of order to allow stars, planets, chemistry, and life to emerge over time.</p>
							<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Entropy doesn't prevent complexity on Earth, but the universe's low initial entropy points to purposeful design at the very beginning.</p>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(4)">
							<span>Are miracles anti-science?</span>
							<span class="expand-icon">+</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-4">
							<p>Science describes the <strong>normal patterns</strong> of nature - the reliable laws that make scientific investigation possible. Miracles are claimed as <strong>exceptional events</strong> where God acts within the story He authored.</p>
							<p><strong>Think of it this way:</strong> If you're reading a book and the author decides to intervene in the plot, that doesn't mean the author is "anti-grammar" or "anti-storytelling rules." The author simply has the freedom to act within their own creation.</p>
							<p>Many scientists who believe in miracles see no contradiction: God normally works through natural laws (which He sustains), but retains the freedom to act directly when necessary for His purposes.</p>
							<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Science studies <em>how</em> things normally work. It can't dictate what the Creator of those laws can or cannot do within His own creation.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(5)">
							<span>Is fine-tuning real or just hype?</span>
							<span class="expand-icon">+</span>
						</div>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-5">
							<p>Fine-tuning is <strong>widely accepted</strong> by physicists across the philosophical spectrum. The constants of nature are balanced on a razor's edge - tiny changes would make stars, chemistry, or life impossible.</p>
							<p><strong>The evidence:</strong></p>
							<ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
								<li>Strong nuclear force 2% different → no chemistry</li>
								<li>Cosmological constant off by 1 in 10^120 → universe collapses or expands too fast</li>
								<li>Gravitational constant slightly different → no stars or stellar burning</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>The debate isn't about <em>whether</em> fine-tuning exists</strong> - it's about <em>why</em>: pure chance, multiverse theories, or intelligent design.</p>
							<p>Even skeptics like Martin Rees acknowledge the "remarkable fine-tuning." The mathematical precision is undeniable - the question is what it means.</p>
