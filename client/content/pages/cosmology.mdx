# Cosmology & Physics

Modern cosmology points to a universe with a beginning and laws fine-tuned for life. These discoveries don’t “prove God,” but they are exactly the sort of features you’d expect if an intelligent Creator wanted a world discoverable by science.

## Big Bang and a Beginning
Evidence like cosmic expansion and the cosmic microwave background supports a finite beginning. That aligns comfortably with “In the beginning...”

## Fine-Tuning
Small changes to constants like gravity or the strong nuclear force would make stars or chemistry impossible. Explanations vary (design, multiverse, unknown mechanisms), yet design remains a reasonable inference.

## Entropy and Order
Low initial entropy allowed structure to emerge. Our ordered cosmos is the canvas on which science paints.
